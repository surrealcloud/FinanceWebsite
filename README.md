# FinanceWebsite
This website was built by myself and three of my peers for the BUILD 23 Hackathon.

It is our first dive into web development, so we picked the popular Python Flask framework and SQLAlchemy 
backend due to the significant amount of resources on the internet for the two. 

We picked the theme of inequality, and believed that a financial tool could help address financial inequality.
By aggregating many finance tools in one place that is as easy to navigate as possible, it could help many people
that have limited access to the internet to build navigate their finances and improve their quality of life.
